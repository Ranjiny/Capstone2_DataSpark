Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, EDA,Python, Data Management using SQL, Power Bi


To effectively approach the data analysis and reporting as outlined, hereâ€™s a detailed plan covering data cleaning and preparation, data loading, and SQL query formulation:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
a. Check for Missing Values
Identify Missing Values: Use pandas to check for missing values in each dataset.
Handle Missing Values: Depending on the context, you might  drop the column with fill missing values or interpolate the values.


b. Convert Data Types
Date Conversion: Ensure date fields are in the correct format.
Numerical Conversion: Ensure numerical fields are properly defined (e.g., converting text to numeric).

c. Merge Datasets
Join Tables: Link related datasets (e.g., sales data with product and customer data).


2. Load Data
a. Create Tables
Define Schema: Create SQL tables for each data source based on the structure of the datasets.

3. Power BI Visualization
a. Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau
Establish Connection: Use the database connection options in Power BI to connect to your SQL database.
b. Import Data
Load Tables: Import the relevant tables into Power BI for analysis.
c. Create Interactive Dashboards
Design Visualizations: Create charts, graphs, and dashboards to visualize key metrics, trends, and insights.

4. Develop 10 SQL Queries
   Develop sql queries for the visualization for Total Sales by Country, Top 10 Best-Selling Products,Sales Trend Over Time etc.

5.Write a report for the key insights and recommondations
